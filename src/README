Shower Deconstruction
==============================

To compile this, execute:

./configure --with-fastjet=[Fastjet directory]

(substituting [Fastjet directory] with the appropriate path for where Fastjet is installed)

The actual code can be compiled with:

make

The libraries will be in the .libs directory.
To link this to your code, use the flags -L[THISDIRECTORY]/.libs -lDeconstruction and rememver to add this directory to your include path.

There is an example code that generates Z prime particles decaying into hadronic tops, makes a C/A R=1.0 jet, takes the leading jet, makes
sub-jets from its constituents with kt R=0.2 and feeds the leading 9 sub-jets to SD.
It can be compiled by adjusting the HepMC, Pythia 8, Fastjet and ROOT paths in compile_test.sh and running:
source compile_test.sh

Execute with ./TestAnalysis --help to see your options.

One can also include --prefix=[dir] in configure and then call make install to install the libraries generated in the
directory to be used in an outside analysis.
